# Sample Feature 
features are collections of small functionalities that together can form an epic. for example, I think if I want to have this feature as part of my big story, I need to do three smaller steps. [step 1](story1/readme.md), [another maybe bigger step](story2/readme.md) and finally the [third](story3/readme.md) one.
